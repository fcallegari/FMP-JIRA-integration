Revision 2 introduces a different method for posting events to Jira, which is done by AJAX POST request.
This method doesn't require FM Plugins (like for v1) or Custom Functions, but simply uses a single Javascript routine that does 
the post request, grabs the results and shows them of with alert messages.
Set up process:
(1) general set up (for "Settings"). This is used to store the REST API settings according to Jira documentation
  (1.1) url: the resource to be addressed
  (1.2) username and password of the user that is creating the issue (should already exist in your Jira instance)
(2) check connection button: this is used to check the server response in the three field at the bottom (Post Response, PostresponseCode
    and PostResponseHeaders)
(3) if ok (ResponseCode = 200) you should see the JSON response in the PostResponse field, where you can grab the projectId and IssueTypeId
    you can use for the next issue creation phase (sorry text is not beautified, might be in future releases...) 
(4) once you have detected the ProjectId and IssueTypeId that will be used for issue creation, store them in the proper fields along with 
    assignee name (must already be present in your Jira instance)
(5) now you have completed the setup process you can test it in the form "Application_AJAX"
