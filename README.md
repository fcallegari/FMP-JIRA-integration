# FMP-JIRA Integration
Script routines for data exchange between FileMakerPro Applications and JIRA Software project management tool.
Purpose: creating the infrastructure for a simplified Help Desk functionality that could be 
added to existing FMP applications. This infrastructure should give final users the capability of sending customized help requests 
directly into Jira Software (ex customized issue-type, like "Request"), thus creating a sort of simplified ticketing system. 
Each request should be able to map a whole set of environmental parameters (like layout#, user account, recordID#, etc.) that would be embedded into the Jira Request Issue in order to help Developers have a clearer picture for problem solving.
